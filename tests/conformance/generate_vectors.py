"""Generate the signed-lane conformance vectors, from this repo's own implementation.

Why this exists: the signed lane is the only lane where `from` means anything, and getting
onto it requires a client to reproduce three things byte-exactly before a signature will
verify — the single-line sweep (`store.clean_text`), the `did:key` encoding
(`didkey.public_key`), and the canonical payload `<room>|<nonce>|<swept text>`. Get any of
them wrong and the server answers 403 with no hint which one it was, because a signature is
pass/fail and carries no diagnosis. Third-party clients now exist in other languages, and
nothing tells them whether they agree with this server.

So: emit the agreement as data. `vectors.json` is generated FROM the implementation, never
hand-written, and `test_conformance.py` asserts the implementation still matches it — so the
file cannot drift from the server, and a change that moves the boundary fails CI here rather
than in someone else's client.

    python tests/conformance/generate_vectors.py           # rewrite vectors.json
    python tests/conformance/generate_vectors.py --check    # exit 1 if it would change

Two representation decisions worth stating, because they are the difference between a vector
file that ports and one that only works in Python:

  - **Text is carried as code points, not as a JSON string.** The sweep's whole job is
    characters that are awkward to carry as text, and one of them cannot be carried at all:
    a lone surrogate (`Cs`) has no UTF-8 encoding, so `json.dumps(..., ensure_ascii=False)`
    followed by a UTF-8 encode raises `UnicodeEncodeError: surrogates not allowed`. JSON's
    grammar itself is not the obstacle — `"\\ud800"` is a legal escape, this file is written
    with `ensure_ascii=True`, and both `json.loads` and JS `JSON.parse` recover the lone
    surrogate exactly. The reason `in_cp`/`out_cp` are authoritative is therefore narrower
    than "JSON cannot hold it": a consumer that re-encodes the parsed string to UTF-8, or
    whose JSON library normalises unpaired surrogates to U+FFFD, silently gets a different
    character — and the point of a conformance vector is to not depend on that. Every case
    carries integer arrays as the authoritative form plus a lossy `in_display` for reading.

  - **The Unicode version is recorded.** The sweep is `unicodedata.category(c) in
    ("Cc","Cf","Cs","Co","Zl","Zp")`, so its result is a function of the Unicode tables the
    runtime ships, not of this code. U+180E moved Zs -> Cf in Unicode 6.3; a JS runtime
    evaluating `\\p{Cf}` uses its own tables. A vector that disagrees across versions is a
    fact about that character, not a bug, and `version_sensitive: true` marks the ones where
    that is the expected answer.

The three traps these vectors exist to catch, all live in the tracker:

  - **Surrogates.** Python iterates a `str` by code point, so U+1F680 is one character of
    category `So` and survives. A client that iterates UTF-16 *code units* — JavaScript's
    `text.split('')`, or `for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++)` — sees two characters of
    category `Cs` and replaces each with a space. Every astral character then signs the
    wrong bytes. `Array.from(text)` / `[...text]` is the correct iteration.
  - **U+FFFD is kept.** The reachable half of the surrogate story, and the trap a client
    falls into while reasoning correctly. `Cs` sweeps to a space, so `a%ED%A0%80b` looks
    like it should store `a b` — but that is CESU-8, the server's UTF-8 decode is lossy
    rather than fatal, and what lands is `a` + three U+FFFD + `b`, category `So`, kept.
    Sweep the bytes that arrived; do not predict the sweep from the bytes you sent.
  - **Signature spelling.** 64 raw bytes is 86 unpadded base64url characters carrying 516
    bits, so the final 4 bits carry no signature and SIXTEEN strings decode to the same 64
    bytes (issue #177). Ed25519 cannot distinguish them — it never sees the encoding — which
    is why #178 constrained the *pattern* instead: `SIG_PATTERN` now pins the last character
    to `AQgw`, so exactly one of the sixteen is accepted and the other fifteen are refused on
    the encoding before any crypto runs. Both halves are recorded here, because a client
    author needs both: `sig_canonical` is the only string the server will take, and
    `sig_same_bytes_spellings` is what makes the constraint necessary rather than arbitrary.
    The trap this leaves is decoder-shaped — `Buffer.from(s, "base64url")` and
    `base64.urlsafe_b64decode` both ignore the slack bits, so a client that decodes and
    re-encodes a signature it received cannot tell it has produced a string the server will
    now reject with a 403.

One thing this file is NOT: a source of identities. The seeds are counting patterns, so the
DIDs derived from them belong to every reader — `test_only` and `warning` say so inside the
JSON rather than only in the README, because a fixture gets copied more often than read.
