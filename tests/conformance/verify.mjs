/**
 * Re-verify the conformance vectors' signatures from a second language.
 *
 * Carried over from @Magicianhax's #314 (Apache-2.0, offered explicitly when that PR was
 * closed in favour of this one) and adapted to this file's schema. The idea is theirs and it
 * is the half `runner.mjs` deliberately does not cover:
 *
 *   - `runner.mjs` REIMPLEMENTS the protocol — sweep, canonical assembly, DID decode — and
 *     diffs its answers against the vectors. That is where clients actually fail, and it
 *     carries a naive sweep beside the correct one so the failure is legible.
 *   - `verify.mjs` reimplements NOTHING. It derives each public key from its `did:key` and
 *     checks that the recorded signature verifies over the recorded bytes. If it passes, the
 *     signatures in this directory are real Ed25519 signatures that a second language's
 *     crypto agrees on — rather than self-marked homework from the generator that wrote them.
 *
 * The one adaptation worth naming: signatures are checked against `payload_utf8_hex`, not
 * against a JSON string field. The payload can contain U+FFFD and NBSP and, in the sweep
 * cases, an unpaired surrogate; reading the bytes as hex means this check does not depend on
 * how `JSON.parse` treats any of them, which is the same reason the sweep cases carry
 * `in_cp`. `payload_display` exists for humans and is not used here.
 *
 *     node tests/conformance/verify.mjs
 *
 * Exit 0 = every signature verifies. Node stdlib only. `test_conformance.py` shells out to
 * this when a `node` binary is present and skips it otherwise, because CI is pure-Python.
