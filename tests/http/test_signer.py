"""scripts/sign.py's CLI is a documented contract — test it like one.

Every claim the script's own docstring makes is a promise a stranger relies on:
both --seed orders work, a keygen seed reproduces the did, every nonce the script
accepts is one the server's NONCE_RE accepts, and a signature it emits is one the
server verifies. All four PR-#54 review findings lived exactly in the gap between
those promises and anything a gate ran; these tests are the gate (issue #56).
